# barley-haplotype-script
This repository contains shell and Perl scripts designed to calculate the Ancestral haplotype group (AHG) of barley and perform statistical analysis based on the AHG matrix.
=======
For the code in the 04.spatiotemporal-origin directory, please note that some parts are specifically designed for haplotypes involving 5 time periods and 5 ancestry groups. If your analysis involves a different number of time periods or ancestry groups, you will need to modify the script accordingly.
